## Overview

Welcome to the **Supervised ML: Predicting Housing Prices** project repository. In this project, we will explore the fascinating world of supervised machine learning by tackling the challenge of predicting housing prices. This project is divided into two major phases:

1. **Phase 1: Binary Classification**
   - Create a model to predict whether a house is expensive or not.
   - This phase involves a classification task with the target labels "Expensive" and "Not expensive."

2. **Phase 2: Regression**
   - Create a model to predict the exact price of a house.
   - This phase involves a regression task with the target variable as the exact price of houses in dollars.

This division between classification and regression tasks is essential for understanding and evaluating machine learning models effectively. Each phase follows a structured approach to solve typical machine learning problems. Here's an outline of the phases:

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Binary Classification

1. **Understand the Context**
   - Dive into the world of housing markets and explore the key factors that drive housing prices. Gain insights into the specific characteristics of the housing market in Iowa, where our dataset is based.

2. **Explore & Clean the Data**
   - Ensure data quality by identifying and addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and data types that need adjustment.

3. **Data Pre-processing**
   - Transform the data to prepare it for modeling. This includes handling missing values, scaling data, and selecting or engineering features.

4. **Modeling**
   - Train classification models to predict whether a house is expensive or not. Compare different models to determine the best-performing one.

5. **Error Analysis**
   - Evaluate the model's performance, considering metrics such as accuracy and precision. Understand the implications of false positives and false negatives in the context of predicting expensive houses.

6. **Implement Your Solution**
   - Report the findings and insights gained from the classification model. Explore potential use cases and real-world applications.

### Phase 2: Regression

1. **Understand the Context**
   - Transition to predicting exact house prices and explore the intricacies of the regression task.

2. **Explore & Clean the Data**
   - Continue to ensure data quality and make necessary adjustments specific to the regression phase.

3. **Data Pre-processing**
   - Prepare the data for regression modeling. Address missing values, scale features, and apply necessary transformations.

4. **Modeling**
   - Train regression models to predict the exact price of houses. Compare different regression algorithms to find the most accurate one.

5. **Error Analysis**
   - Assess the regression model's accuracy and understand the extent to which it can be used in practice.

6. **Implement Your Solution**
   - Report the regression model's findings and insights. Explore potential applications for predicting exact house prices.

### Additional Challenge: Mushroom Classification

As part of testing the models with a different use case, we will tackle the challenge of classifying mushrooms as either poisonous or non-poisonous. This is a critical task, especially during the mushroom hunting season, to prevent accidental consumption of toxic mushrooms. The project will include guidance on identifying features indicative of poisonous mushrooms.

## Project Workflow

Machine learning projects are iterative and often follow an agile approach. We will start by building a simple Minimum Viable Product (MVP) solution and iteratively improve it as we gain insights and expertise. Here's a simplified workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data about housing prices and mushroom attributes.

2. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Understand the data and clean it to ensure its quality and reliability.

3. **Data Pre-processing**: Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection.

4. **Modeling**: Train machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks.

5. **Error Analysis**: Evaluate model performance and understand its limitations.

6. **Implementation**: Report findings, share insights, and explore real-world applications.

By following this structured approach, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of supervised machine learning, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
